(binary content - not creating actual image, but would be needed. For now creating a dummy file to avoid errors if browser checks, actually browser ignores missing icons usually or shows default. I will stick to text description, but to be safe I'll just create a tiny empty file or skip the icon definition if user didn't provide one. Wait, I added icon.png to manifest. I should create a dummy one or remove it. I'll remove it from manifest in next step if it errors, but for now I'll create a simple HTML file act as icon? No. I will create a simple popup.html and js.)

Actually, I won't create an icon.png file. I'll let the user know they can add one, or I'll just remove the icon reference from manifest if it causes issues. Chrome usually handles missing icons gracefully (shows puzzle piece).

Let's focus on popup.html.
